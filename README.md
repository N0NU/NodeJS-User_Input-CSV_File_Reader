# NodeJS-User_Input-CSV_File_Reader

Clone or download this repo.

In the cloned or downloaded directory: 

open cmd in the directory and run command: npm install

It will install all the dependencies, although I have only used csvtojson.

after npm install finishes run npm start.

It will ask for time interval, give any number like 23

Then it will ask for file names you can give multiple or single file name its upto you

Then it will read the data from those files and shows the response based on the condition like in my case it will show only those records with ZEC-AUD, LTC-AUD and BTC-AUD unique_identifier.
